EDA Summary:
Coffee is the best-selling product by far, followed by bread and tea. The bakery seems to be making most of its sales in the afternoon everyday with over 56% of the sales. Sales fall sharply after that. However the bakery makes a decent amount of sales in the morning as well. For obvious reasons, the sales are high as expected during the weekends. However the sales seem to be quite uniform rest of the days. The bakery seems to be heavily occupied and makes most of its business from November to March.
